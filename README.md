How to Run Tests
*Requires JUnit
(Tests for Iteration 4) Run the DroneSubsystemTest, IncidentMessageTest and IncidentTest. If they pass then Faults are detected and handled.

Changes implemented in Fourth Iteration
Addition of fault detection using timing events
Detection of zone arrival failures and stuck nozzle/bay doors
Hard fault handling for nozzle/bay door issues (drone shutdown)
Input file format updated to support fault injection
System updated to log and display drone faults in status output
Testing of fault detection and system recovery logic
Updated Class Diagram to reflect new fault handling components
